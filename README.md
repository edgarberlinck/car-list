# Volvo UI Technical Test

## Requirements

 - I need to create two subpages: /learn/<carId> and /shop/<carId>
 - Try to use [VCC-UI](https://vcc-ui.vercel.app/)
 - Try to create a filter for `bodyType`
 - make sure the page is accessible (https://playwright.dev/docs/accessibility-testing)
 - good component design
 - try to not use 3rd party libs (VCC-UI is considered a internal lib, so it's fine if I use it)

 ## Data display
  
  - Both views display a carousel. The desktop version shows two arrows and the mobile shows dots
